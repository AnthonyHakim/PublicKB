### Overview

Partner Cloud Integration allows an Cloud Application Manager user to create AWS Customer Accounts or transfer an existing one into CenturyLink's care. If you want to stop usage and completely shut down that AWS Customer Account, you must do more than delete the provider in Cloud Application Manager. You will also need to tell CenturyLink to turn off the actual AWS account.

### Audience

### Prerequisites

You will need to have followed an Optimized AWS account.

You will need to delete the associated Azure provider at some point, before or after submitting the request described below.

### Important Information

Please provide the following information for the delete:
